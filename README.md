## DEBLOATING THE ROM ##
You will already have the debolated rom from all the original SUNMI OS apps even the main ones that take cares of SN activation... (if you know what i mean) ((proinfo.bin -- hex editor üòè‚Äã)).


BUT.
I do already included magisk manager v29 with a patched boot image so you can do whatever you want with it and install whatever you need. 
I do excluded anything related to Google Play 'cause it will make the rom so slow but i do already installed for you some apps:

- Aurora Store
- Simple Pixel Launcher FOSS (yeah the sunmi one was soooo bad)
- FOSS Material File Manager with root explorer enabled
- Via Browser (it's so good and so lightweight damn)
